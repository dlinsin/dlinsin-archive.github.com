title: AppCode Screencast
---

A couple of weeks ago I [blogged](http://dlinsin.github.com/2011/08/27/AppCode.html) about [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/ "AppCode") and my reasons to stick with it, even though it wasn't production ready yet. Since then Jetbrains announce that [AppCode 1.0 is imminent](http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/jetbrains_appcode/~3/HYzRH80bAvI/) and released a beta version.

They also give you the [chance to get a free version](http://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2011/09/show-why-you-love-appcode-and-get-it-free-oh-and-win-an-ipad/), by show off what you like about AppCode in a screencast. Since I'm already in love with AppCode, I took my chances and produced a video of my favorite features. Unfortunately, I only noticed the horrible quality only after I already edited and tweaked the whole thing. I do apologize and hope you like it anyways.
