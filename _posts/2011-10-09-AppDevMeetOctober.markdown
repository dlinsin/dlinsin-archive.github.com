As mentioned [last week](http://dlinsin.github.com/2011/09/28/AppDevMeetOctober.html), 
the dates for AppDev Meet October were up for voting on [Doodle](http://doodle.com/2scu8yvs2353wmru). 
Although, there was a choice between 2 suitable dates, there can only be one winner:

**App Dev Meet October will be on Wednesday, October 19th 18:00 at [Starbucks near Neumarkt in Cologne](http://goo.gl/CrhYU) ([Calendar Export](http://doodle.com/export/ics?optionIndex=6&locale=en&timeZone=Europe%2FBerlin&adminKey=&pollId=2scu8yvs2353wmru&participantKey=))**

Last time there was plenty of space, however please remember: 
Starbucks is a public venue, seats are available on first come first serve basis.
