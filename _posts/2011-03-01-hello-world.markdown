title: Hello World
---

When developers are talking about ["Hello World"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hello_world_program "Wikipedia on Hello World"), they usually talk about their first steps in a new programming language. When I say "Hello World" today, I am talking about my first steps in mobile development. 

If you are reading this, you are probably aware of my [other mobile endavours](http://furryfishApps.com/wordbuzz "furryfishApps - Word Buzz") and might be asking yourself right now: why "Hello World"? Why first steps? Well, today is my first day of iOS-only and full time mobile development at [GrandCentrix GmbH](http://grandcentrix.net "GrandCentrix GmbH") in Cologne.

GrandCentrix is your full service provider for mobile solutions. We provide ready to use mobile marketing, productivity and customer-service Apps for various platforms and industries. 

I'm really excited about this change! My spare time passion for iOS development turns into my day job, which means I can put a 120% of my efforts and concentration into building awesome Apps.
