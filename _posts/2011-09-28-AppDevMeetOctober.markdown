title: AppDev Meet October
---

Our [first AppDev Meet](http://dlinsin.github.com/2011/09/04/FirstAppDevMeet.html) 
took place a couple of weeks ago with [@sutinisaid](http://twitter.com/sutinisaid), [@coderWarning](http://twitter.com/coderWarning), 
[@daniel_a_a](http://twitter.com/daniel_a_a) and [@anGrauel](http://twitter.com/anGrauel). 
We talked about @coderWarning's plans for his iOS App ["Risikoanalyse"](http://itunes.apple.com/app/risikoanalyse/id446628827?mt=8) as well as development 
for the Mac with @daniel_a_a and his App ["Timing"](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/timing-time-tracking-for-humans/id431511738?mt=12).

Our October installment will take place here in Cologne again, following the same [formular](https://gist.github.com/1170946). 
In order to find a date, we'd like to ask you to head over to [doodle](http://doodle.com/2scu8yvs2353wmru) and fill in your dates of choice.

We'll announce the winning date on twitter, so if you haven't already, you should follow
