I recently announced on [twitter](http://twitter.com/#!/furryfishApps/status/103699334406742016), that I'd be using [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc/ "AppCode"), the Objective-C IDE from Jetbrains, in 
production for at least one week. It's almost two weeks now, here's what I experienced.

I'll get to the point quickly here: It's a pleasure to develop with AppCode! If you are looking for a 
strong editor with solid refactoring support, go get AppCode's 1.0 and never use Xcode's editor 
again. If you've used any other Jetbrains product, you'll feel at home instantly. Version Control 
works out of the box and the debugging UI is a lot more stable than in Xcode. 

If I haven't convinced you yet, keep on reading. 

AppCode has great refactoring support. Out of the box, the most important refactorings are 
assigned to keyboard shortcuts, you are accustomed to if you've used e.g. [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea). However, the 
biggest advantage over Xcode is the variety of refactorings: "Introduce Variable" or "Extract Block" 
is something that Xcode doesn't offer you and I would already miss it.

The stability of the EAP build is great, it's still buggy, but let's face it: you've probably seen Xcode's 
"Crash or Continue" dialog [at least](http://twitter.com/bmf/status/106144603647909889) [once](http://twitter.com/chockenberry/status/106068158145765376) the past couple days - with a "stable" version. No matter 
what went wrong the past week AppCode never crashed! You get a notification, indicating 
something went wrong and a textfield to report a bug, which can be submitted directly from the 
App. However, everything kept working - no restart required.

Although AppCode is great, there are some problems, which I mostly blame on the fact it's still EAP.

I wasn't able to debug my iOS Apps on any device, which basically is a no-go for production usage. 
However, the iOS Simulator works fine, so I used Xcode for device debugging and AppCode for 
development. In a stable version this must be fixed, though.

I only needed Xcode for Interface Builder, to edit Core Data Models or archiving/submitting to the 
App Store. Those things are not possible in AppCode and frankly, I don't think they'll ever be. 
I could imagine, that editing Core Data Models might be included, however for the other two tasks 
you'll need to fall back to Xcode. Personally, I don't mind switching between applications, however, 
I can see that this might not appeal to everyone. 

I'll continue using AppCode, even in production, since for me a strong editor is much more worth 
than an integrated experience. However, I'm looking forward for AppCode's first stable version.
