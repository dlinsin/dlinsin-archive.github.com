title: In My Humble Opinion
---

_In my humble opinion_ aka _IMHO_ is a phrase you hear quite often in technical discussions 
found on blogs or [twitter](http://twitter.com/dlinsin). It's nothing new and doesn't need further 
explanation, since you've used it probably a thousand times, just like me. However, I'd like to 
talk about the small, but quite important difference between __opinion__ and __fact__. 

I think (notice, how I didn't use _IMHO_ here) that in most cases, especially when using _IMHO_ in 
a face to face discussion, the word __opinion__ actually could be replaced with __fact__, 
__truth__ or __verity__. 

I have noticed this for a while and came to the conclusion that the iOS developer community 
is worse in this regard than the Java community. I'm not too sure why. I assume it's due to 
the fact that most of the iOS developers are working on their own, whereas the typical Java 
developer usually works in a team. I guess you tend to confuse __opinion__ with __fact__ much 
easier, if you are the only one involved in a project. Every decision you make caters to your 
own needs and is mostly a perfect fit. 

A couple of years ago I read a blog post from [Jeff Atwood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Atwood) 
on [Coding Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/05/strong-opinions-weakly-held.html), 
which has been my mantra in terms of voicing my opinion ever since:

> I suppose it's also an issue of personal style. To me, writing without a strong voice, writing filled with second guessing and disclaimers, is tedious and difficult to slog through. I go out of my way to write in a strong voice because it's more effective. But whenever I post in a strong voice, it is also an implied invitation to a discussion, a discussion where I often change my opinion and invariably learn a great deal about the topic at hand. I believe in the principle of strong opinions, weakly held

I have been applying the principle of __strong opinions, weakly held__ in almost every discussion 
I had or blog post I published. 

My opinions are usually deduced from personal experience and observation, so I will try 
to defend them to a certain degree. However, I'm more than happy to reconsider my position, 
if there's a valid argument against it.
