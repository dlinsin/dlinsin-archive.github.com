title: First AppDev Meet 
---

A couple of weeks ago, [I blogged about](http://dlinsin.github.com/2011/08/25/AppDevMeet.html) our plans for the [first AppDev Meet](https://gist.github.com/1170946) here in Cologne. 
The feedback was amazing and we had a good number of people participating in our [poll](http://doodle.com/erxb67rqzr57298k) to find a date. 
Luckily we had a clear winner:

**The first App Dev Meet will be on Tuesday, September 13th 18:00 at [Starbucks near Neumarkt in Cologne](http://goo.gl/CrhYU)**

We think there should be enough space for everyone who participated in the doodle. However please remember: 
Starbucks is a public venue, seats are available on first come first serve basis.
 
If you haven't already, you should follow App Dev Meet on Twitter [@appdevmeet](http://twitter.com/appdevmeet) to stay up to date!
