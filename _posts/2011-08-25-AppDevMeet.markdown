[Sutini](http://twitter.com/sutinisaid) had this great idea for a meet up similar to 
[NSCoderNight](http://nscodernight.com), but with a design angle. 
Welcome [AppDev Meet](https://gist.github.com/1170946)! Here's our pitch:



> What? "AppDev Meet"? Shouldn't it be called "NSCoderNight" or something?



Yes and no! We wanted to start something fresh and new, so we decided to update the name. 



> Okay!?! So is it still about code and stuff?



Sure! AppDev Meet is about iOS and Mac development as well as UI/UX-Design. We want to 
hang out, code and meet fellow developers and designers from the Cologne area.



> Will there be a presentation?



Nope! No slides, no talk and no presentation. Just bring yourself, your code or design and 
some stuff to talk about. That doesn't mean there won't be presentations or talks in the 
future. However, it's not in scope for version 1.0.



> Sounds cool, where can I sign up?



Actually, you don't have to sign up! No, seriously! AppDev Meet is based on the idea 
to meet up once or twice a month on a weekday after work - you just show up or you don't. 
No strings attached - no hard feelings in case you cannot make it. 

We'll meet up at [Starbucks at Neumarkt in Cologne](http://goo.gl/CrhYU) [1]. It's easy to 
find and easy to reach. 



> So when's the next AppDev Meet?



You decide! We set up a [doodle](http://doodle.com/erxb67rqzr57298k) to schedule possible 
dates for a kick-off. The dates with the most votes wins - easy. 


Please help us spread the word to fellow iOS/Mac developers as well as UI/UX-Designers. 
You can follow on Twitter [@appdevmeet](http://twitter.com/appdevmeet) for the latest updates!



[1] in case there's no space at Starbucks for the estimated crowd, we can relocate to another 
location in Cologne, so keep an eye on [@appdevmeet](http://twitter.com/appdevmeet).
