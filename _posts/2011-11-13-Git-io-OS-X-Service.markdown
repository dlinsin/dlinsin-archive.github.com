title: Git.io OS X Service
---

I'm a [big fan](http://twitter.com/#!/dlinsin/status/110584408817405953) of [GitHub](http://github.com) as 
some of you might know, so it was a pleasant surprise when they released their very own 
URL shortener - [Git.io](https://github.com/blog/985-git-io-github-url-shortener). 

Services like that always [inspire me](https://github.com/dlinsin/github-java-api) to build 
stuff on top of them. It's just great to see companies you love come up with cool stuff to play with. 
Sutini and I even had a brainstorming session over a nice cup of Starbucks coffee whether 
this would be a project for [furryfishApps](http://furryfishApps.com). I wanted a simple way to 
generate Git.io URLs for pasting into E-Mails or Tweets. I could think of more features, 
but that's the basic requirement. 

Eventually, I decided to come up with a simple Mac OS X Service. When installed, you can highlight 
any GitHub URL, navigate to OS X's Services Menu and generate a Git.io URL. You'll get a nice 
[Growl](http://growl.info/) notification displaying the original URL and the shortened version. 
In addition to that you can instantly paste the Git.io URL into your E-Mail or Tweet. 

There's a lot to improve and it doesn't work under certain conditions, however you can grab 
an unpolished version of the Service from my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dlinsin/Git.io-OS-X-Service).
